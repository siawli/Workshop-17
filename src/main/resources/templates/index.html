        <!--
            th:action="@{/currency}" find the method that has the path "/currency"
            method="post"
            so will look for @PostMapping("/currency") and pass the form input
            into this method in the controller
        -->
        <p1>From: 
            <select th:name="countryFrom">
                <option th:each="country : ${countries}" 
                        th:value="${country.currencyID}"

        <!--
            th:name="countryFrom" -> we didn't set a th:object here, so there's
            no bag to carry my inputs from the form. So we set a th:name here.
            countries is the List<CurrencyModel> that contain of our currencyModel
            that we had stored inside when looping
            so we have AF, AI, ... and each has their own currenyID, 
            currencyAndSymbol, symbol and currencyName
            so th:each="country : ${countries}" will loop through the List<CurrencyModel>
            th:value=${country.currencyID} -> e.g. would be "AFN" -> this would be 
            the input sent to the form
            th:text is the what is shown on the dropdown list -> e.g. "Afghan afghani Ø‹"
            so th:name = "countryFrom" th:value="$country.currencyID"
            in the payload after submitting (cuz POST method so it will be contained
            in the payload), it will appear as "countryFrom: AFN"
        -->

        <p1>To: 
            <select th:name="countryTo">
                <option th:each="country : ${countries}"

                        th:text="${country.currencyAndSymbol}"></option>
            </select>
            <!--
                th:name="countryTo" th:value=${country.currencyID}
                payload would be "countryTo=XCD"
            -->

        </p1>
        <p1>Amount: <input type="text" th:name="amount"/></p1>

            ok, now go to controller @PostMapping
